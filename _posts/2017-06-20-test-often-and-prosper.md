Derek Eskens
Senior Consultant, Object In this presentation you'll be introduced to the Spock testing & mocking framework. We'll see how writing tests in Spock compares to JUnit and why it will save you time; which will make you enjoy writing tests; which will make you a better programmer; which will make you more money.

If you're a Java developer, you'll also be introduced to Groovy. Using Groovy in testing code is a great introduction to the language and a foot in the door to getting it accepted as a language standard within your company.

If you haven't been using JDK 8, the functional concepts and collection comprehensions in Groovy will change your life.
