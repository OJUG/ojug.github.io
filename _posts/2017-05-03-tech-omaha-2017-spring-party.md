Spring is here and summer is upon us again. This can only mean one thing – the fourth annual spring Tech Omaha Happy Hour! Let’s get together, build community, and make some new friends. The Omaha Mobile Meetup (http://www.meetup.com/Omaha-Mobile-Group), NebraskaJS (http://nebraskajs.com/), Beer and Code Omaha (http://www.beerandcode.org/), Omaha Java Users Group (http://ojug.org/), Omaha Ruby, Omaha .Net User’s Group (http://www.omahamtg.com/), Omaha Android Developers Group (http://www.meetup.com/Omaha-Android-Developers/), Nebraska Drupalers (http://www.meetup.com/drupal-nebraska/), Agile for Defense (https://www.meetup.com/Agile-for-Defense/), Nebraska Virtual Reality Meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Omaha-Virtual-Reality-Meetup) and the rest of the great Omaha tech meet ups (http://techomaha.com/list-omaha-user-groups/) have joined forces with Tech Omaha to throw a Happy Hour during Omaha Startup Week (https://omaha.startupweek.co/) on Wednesday May 3rd, from 5pm to 9pm at the Slowdown in north downtown. This event is open to all of the great Developers and Technologists around our community. Meet new people, catch up with old friends, and see how great our tech community can be working together. We are happy to be part of Omaha Start Up Week this year. Check out some of the other great events happening around town. (https://omaha.startupweek.co/)

Thanks to our generous sponsors, we will have food, some great door prizes to give away, and an open tab for happy hour, available on a first come, first serve basis. Once our funds run out, you’ll be on your own for drinks. Due to venue capacity registration is limited, and an RSVP via SplashThat is required (https://techomaha.splashthat.com/).
