Clojure is a modern Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine as well as in the Browser via the provided javascript engine. It breaks from Object Oriented programming and treats immutable data a core feature of the language. As we move into a world with multiple core processors, Immutability helps with concurrent computing. This talk will be an intro into functional programming concepts along with an intro to the Clojure language.
