title:  "July 19, 2022 The Art of Java Language Pattern Matching with Simon Ritter"
---

Please join us in-person (w/ taco bar and Drinks!) as Simon Ritter (@speakjava on twitter) visits us in-person -- traveling all the way from London! Simon is doing a Java Users Group tour of the US and we are excited to host him on Tuesday, July 19th here in Omaha!

**Abstract:**
The goal of project Amber within OpenJDK is to explore the inclusion of smaller, productivity-oriented Java language features. One part of this that has delivered new functionality in recent versions is *pattern matching*.

Pattern matching combines application code logic to test if an expression has a specific type or structure and extract components of its state for processing.

In JDK 14, JEP 305 introduced pattern matching for instanceof, as a preview feature; in JDK 16, this was made a full feature through JEP 394. This simplifies the use of this operator by eliminating the need for an explicit cast and assignment. In JDK 17, JEP 406 added pattern matching for switch. It is now possible to include patterns in switch case labels.

In this session, we’ll look at the details of these two new language features and a more general look at pattern matching. We’ll also explore future features in this area, such as record patterns (scheduled for JDK 19) and array patterns, which may be included in a subsequent Java release.

By the end of the session, you’ll be ready to use these powerful new features.

**Speaker:**
Simon Ritter ([https://twitter.com/speakjava](https://twitter.com/speakjava)) is the Deputy CTO of Azul Systems.
