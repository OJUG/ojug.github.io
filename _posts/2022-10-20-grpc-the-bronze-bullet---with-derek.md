title:  "October 20, 2022 gRPC: The Bronze Bullet - with Derek Eskens"
---

Please join us in-person (w/ food and drinks!) as Derek Eskens presents "gRPC: The Bronze Bullet"!

**Abstract:**
Once upon a time working outside your own playground might have meant delving into the world of Remote Procedure Calls with SOAP and the `WS-*` baggage that came along with it.

That pain eventually gave way to REST which reigned supreme for over a decade.

As RESTful APIs start to creak with age, GraphQL looks like the shiny new answer for some. But don't overlook the adage "what's old is new again".

In this talk we'll discuss why you might consider resurrecting Remote Procedure Calls with [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).

Learn:
\* What exactly is gRPC
\* Why it's different this time
\* Why it's better/worse than _____________
\* Why and where you might want to use it

**Speaker:**
Derek Eskens ([@snekse](https://twitter.com/snekse/)) is an independent consultant with 20+ years of development experience in a broad array of industries and technologies.

Most recently as Director of Modern APIs, the focus has been around surfacing best practices for integrating JVM services with front-end and other technologies.

Derek also spent many years in hospitality and customer service. That exposure has influenced how he approaches software; heâ€™ll always be an experience advocate striving to make things simpler, faster, and more reliable.
