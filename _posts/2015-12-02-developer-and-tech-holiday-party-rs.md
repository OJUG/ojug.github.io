The holidays are upon us again and provides us a great excuse to get together as community. The Omaha Mobile Meetup, NebraskaJS, Beer and Code Omaha, Omaha Java Users Group, Open Nebraska, Omaha Ruby, Omaha .Net User's Group, Omaha Android Developers Group, and Nebraska Drupalers have joined forces to throw a Developer & Tech Holiday Party on Wednesday December 2nd, from 5pm to 9pm at the Beercade in Benson. This event is open to all of the great Developers and Technologist around our community. Come on out and share knowledge, stories, and drinks with the entire community. Meet new people, catch up with all freinds, and see how great our tech community can be working together.

Thanks to our generous sponsors, we'll have snacks and an open tab for happy hour, available on a first come, first serve basis. Once our funds run out, you'll be on your own for drinks. If you'd like to attend, please RSVP so we have an estimate of how many people will be coming, but please join us even if you don't get a chance to RSVP.

We're still actively seeking sponsors for this community event. If you or your company is interested in sponsoring, please contact Kevin Berry ( kberry (at) AdviseDesign.com ) or any of the organizers of the supporting groups. Developer & Tech Happy Hour events are grassroots initiatives organized by tech leaders in Omaha to support our need to make connections within the tech community. We would greatly appreciate your support, and we will openly recognize your efforts in supporting this initiative. In return for your support, you'll get your logo on the event site, you can hand out great swag at our event, and we'll make announcements during the event to thank you and our other great sponsors so that the tech community knows who loves and supports them.
