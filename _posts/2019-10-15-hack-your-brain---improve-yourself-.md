Your job isn’t 100% code, so improving skills like how you learn, how to focus, and coping mechanisms need to be worked on just like learning a new framework. Everyone has struggles, whether it is accepting criticism, managing stress, or finding time for passion projects. But those don’t have to hold us back! We'll learn 4 techniques to help with these exact issues. Even if you never go to “soft skills” talks, these techniques can help you grow, improve and maybe stick with a new habit for once.

About the Speaker:
Christine is from Omaha, Nebraska where she works as a full stack Ruby on Rails engineer at Flywheel, Delightful Wordpress Hosting for Creatives. She has 12 years experience as a Java engineer with a focus on APIs, testing, and micro-services (before they were cool). Then to change it up, she took the plunge into Ruby in 2018. In her spare time she is an avid reader, huge Rush fan and is attempting to work through the primary Ashtanga yoga series.
