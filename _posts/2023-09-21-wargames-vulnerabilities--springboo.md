title:  "September 21, 2023 Wargames Vulnerabilities & SpringBoot 2 to 3 w/ Gerrit Grunwald & Ivar Grimstad"
---

A special treat for September, we have 2 great speakers from Europe on a national JUG tour stopping in Omaha -- Gerrit Grunwald from Germany, and Ivar Grimstad from Sweden -- giving 2 great talks!

**Titles:**

"**Wargames - Java vulnerabilities and why you should care**" -- from **Gerrit Grunwald** \- Senior Developer Advocate at Azul and Münster Germany JUG leader\!

"**From Spring Boot 2 To Spring Boot 3 with Java 21 and Jakarta EE**" -- from **Ivar Grimstad** \- Jakarta EE Dev Advocate at the Eclipse Foundation and Malmö Sweden JUG leader\!

**Wargames abstract:**

Java is great and we all spend time on making it more performant, more scalable and maintainable. But we better should also spend some time on making it more secure. With all that new Java releases and features also come new vulnerabilities and exploits. Because Java is everywhere, it has a huge attack surface which makes it interesting for hackers to search for vulnerabilities in Java and foremost in Java based applications. I'm not a Java security specialist and if you are like me wonder what all these mystique acronyms like NVD, CVE, CVSS, CPU, PSU etc. mean and how they are related to Java security, come to this session and I will explain it to you. It will also be shown what tools are available to you to check whether your Java application is vulnerable to known issues.

**Spring Boot / Java EE abstract:**

Jakarta EE 9 changed its package namespace from javax.\* to jakarta.\*. This may sound like a trivial change that mostly affects Jakarta EE. So, why should Spring developers care?

As it turns out, the namespace changes ripple throughout the entire Java ecosystem. And Spring is no exception. Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 raised their baseline to Jakarta EE 9 API level which is supported by Tomcat 10 and Jetty 11 for example.

Attending this session will teach you how to make this migration as smooth as possible. A live coding demo will take you through the steps involved, and point out where to pay special attention.

We will also briefly examine some of the changes planned for Jakarta EE 11 that will prepare you for what to expect in future versions of Spring.
