title:  "May 17, 2016 SOLID Code"
---

"Is your code SOLID? How do you know if your code is SOLID? One way to solidify your code is by following the SOLID design principles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) and other principles of good design. At this meetup, Jessica Codr will lead us through these principles by showing examples of code that could be improved and getting your feedback on how to improve that code. Along the way, we will identify SOLID and other principles that we can apply to our everyday coding lives.

After we've seen these examples we will, as time allows, work together on refactoring a code base to better adhere to principles of good design, with the end goal of making the code more maintainable and extendable.

This will be an interactive session, so come willing to share your thoughts as we all learn and grow together!"
