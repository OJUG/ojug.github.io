---

Time Changes!
5:15 - Networking & Pizza
5:45 - Presentation

Please join us as we hear about Abby Jones' personal journey from teaching in the classroom to becoming a software engineer and how the skills she learned in the classroom translated into her new role. Abby taught special education for over a decade and then joined Mutual of Omaha in 2016 as a member of the Solution Architecture division's Mentoring Practice. She helped create their Front End Developers Community of Practice and was a member of the Talent Strategy Steering Committee. Most recently, Abby has been working with teams building software on the Amazon Web Services platform. Outside of work, her favorite activity is jamming out on guitar and hand percussion with her two-year-old niece.

WiTH will be combining this meeting with our local OJUG group. TEK Systems is our sponsor and will provide us with pizza, pop and water. Our host for the event is Blue Cross Blue Shield, 1919 Aksarben Dr.

Networking will begin at 5:15, with Abby hitting the stage around 5:45. We'll be sure to leave plenty of time for Q&A at the end.
