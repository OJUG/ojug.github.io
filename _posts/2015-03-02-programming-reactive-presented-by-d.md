Programming Reactive

Big data, smart phones, tablets, wearable devices, multicore processors,…—we're seeing rapid and drastic evolution in both the computing environments and the application needs. Thankfully, a number of technologies have been evolving over the past several years to meet these demands. The reactive manifesto is an attempt to reenforce a set of technical practices needed to meet the emerging demands.

If you've heard and read about reactive programming, but are eager to realize that in code, then this presentation is for you. We will start with a rapid introduction and get into code to learn about reactive programming, not in theory but with practical examples.
