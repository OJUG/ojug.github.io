JUnit, Maven, Regular expressions that will make you want to self-immolate, Google Service API Keys, Nifty Javascript animations, Web Storage

Speaker:

Tom McLaughlin (https://github.com/tmcoma) is giving his first ever OJUG talk. It'll rock!

Presentation 2: Kotlin (https://kotlinlang.org/) - Why your next language will be Kotlin!

Kotlin is not just YALFTJVM (yet another language for the JVM). There's good reason that Kotlin is the next JVM language that you will learn and use. Fan of Groovy, or Scala, or into writing build scripts, or writing Android code? Learn from this talk the in's & out's, pros and cons, and reasons why Kotlin is worth looking into.

Speaker:

Jeff Sheets (https://twitter.com/sheetsj) is very cool. His talks are always wonderful.
