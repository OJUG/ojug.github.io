Can you feel it in the air? It's time to break out a nerdy Advent Calendar! Never mind the sweltering temperatures (or the actual calendar day), we'll be solving winter-themed programming challenges!

Bring your laptop and work on programming puzzles from Advent Of Code: http://adventofcode.com/

Solve problems in Java, or your favorite JVM programming language. Jessica Codr (https://mobile.twitter.com/jcake09) will then lead a discussion where we compare and contrast different approaches.

No laptop? New to Java? No worries, we encourage pair programming!

Location: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska, 1919 Aksarben Dr, Omaha, NE 68180

Agenda:

5:30 Networking
6:00 Food – Courtesy of TekSystems
