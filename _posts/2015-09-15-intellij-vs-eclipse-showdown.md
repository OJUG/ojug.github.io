title:  "September 15, 2015 IntelliJ vs Eclipse Showdown"
---

Think of your classic rivalries:

• Sega versus Nintendo

• Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant

• PC versus Mac

• Tabs versus Spaces

The most contentious of all: Eclipse or IntelliJ? We’ll be settling this score, once and for all!

Join us this month for an Epic IDE Showdown – we have champions on each side (David Zemon for IntelliJ, Paul Heaberlin for Eclipse) ready to showcase their editor’s features, trash talk their opponent, and definitively prove which 200 megabyte zip you should be downloading the next morning.

Bios:

David Zemon is an technology evangelist raised by two computer engineering graduates. His free time is entirely consumed by programming the Parallax Propeller microcontroller (with JetBrains CLion).

Paul Heaberlin has been working with Java as a backend dev for over a decade and still enjoys it! He’s presented at OJUG a few times, and if given the chance will likely talk your ear off on any topic he knows about (and probably a few he doesn’t).

Location: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska, 1919 Aksarben Dr, Omaha, NE 68180

Agenda:

5:30 Networking
6:00 Food – Courtesy of TekSystems
6:30 Presentation
8-ish Drinks and more at DJ’s Dugout (Aksarben)

Also, in the FREE STUFF department, JetBrains is giving us a free IntelliJ IDEA license to raffle away! So stick around for the drawing at the end of the meeting before we head to DJ’s!
