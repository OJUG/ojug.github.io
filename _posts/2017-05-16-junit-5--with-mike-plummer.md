Mike Plummer will be presenting JUnit5

*Up your testing game with JUnit 5* The latest in the venerable JUnit suite, version five fixes many of the annoyances while modernizing and opening up the platform. This version improves JUnit testing to use the newest Java features like Lambdas, expands the ability to control and monitor the test lifecycle, and introduces new constructs to support Behavior Driven Development (BDD). We'll talk about how to use all of these features as well as how to get them up-and-running alongside your existing test suite.
