title:  "September 20, 2016 Mirror -- Demo & architecture discussion/code walk-through"
---

Presentation:

The presentation will be a short demo and then architecture discussion/code walk-through of mirror (https://github.com/stephenh/mirror), a two-way/real-time version of rsync.

Mirror (https://github.com/stephenh/mirror) is built on top of grpc (http://www.grpc.io/), which is Google's new RPC-over-Protobuf project, so we'll also briefly cover how that works, what the proto files look like, etc.

Speaker:

Stephen Haberman (http://www.draconianoverlord.com/) is very cool. His talks are always wonderful.
