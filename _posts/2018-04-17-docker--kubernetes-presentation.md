â€¢ What we'll do
6-6:30 food and networking
6:30 - presentation

Ryan Hochstetler will present on docker.

Bring your laptops and code along! We will provision a virtual server in Google and do some basic Docker. Then we'll create a cluster with Google Kubernetes Engine and go over Kubernetes basics. No local laptop setup required. Cloud Platform fees covered at no cost to you during the presentation.

It's helpful, but not required to email ryan.hochstetler@gmail.com with your Google account name before the presentation so that he can authorize you on a Google Cloud Platform project. If you don't pre-register, there may not be enough clusters provisioned for everyone.
