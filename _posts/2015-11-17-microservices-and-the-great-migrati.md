The Great Migration

Micro-services have been getting a lot of attention in the past year, but is it really a viable solution or just a passing fad?

In this presentation we'll look deep into Bintray.com (http://bintray.com/)'s service architecture and talk about how and why we found ourselves naturally migrating from a central web application to a flock of micro-services.

Of course maybe a groovy puzzle or two if we have time :-)
