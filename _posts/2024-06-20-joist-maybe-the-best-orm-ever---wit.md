title:  "June 20, 2024 Joist, Maybe the Best ORM Ever - With Stephen Haberman"
---

Please join us (w/ food and drinks!) as **Stephen Haberman** presents "**Joist - Maybe the Best ORM Ever**"!

We'll be joining forces with [Nebraska JavaScript](https://www.meetup.com/nebraskajs/) this session; come meet some new friends!

**Abstract:**
Joist is a new TypeScript ORM with several novel features like N+1 prevention and "bringing reactivity to the backend". We'll compare/contrast its capability to canonical Java ORMs like Hibernate, and learn how JavaScript & TypeScript enable many of its core innovations.

**Speaker:**
Stephen Haberman is an engineer who's been practicing software in the Omaha area for awhile now, first doing Java backend systems while enterprise consulting, and lately full-stack TypeScript for Homebound, a startup/general contractor that builds homes for residential construction.

**Schedule:**
Food and Networking: 5:30 - 6:00
Presentation: 6:00 - 7:00
Jetbrains IntelliJ license raffle for in-person attendees after the talk!
