title:  "February 17, 2015 Java Security and AngularJS"
---

Apache Shiro is an excellent java security framework. Shiro security can be used when your java application is providing an API to a single page angularJS app. Joen Moreno from Bass and Associates (Harbinger Partners) show us how to use Shiro to secure an angularJS single page web app. You'll remember Joen from his record setting May 2014 AngularJS for Java Developers presentation. He's a great speaker!
