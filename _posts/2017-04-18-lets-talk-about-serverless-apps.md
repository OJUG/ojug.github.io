Agenda:

1) What is "Serverless Architecture"?

2) Set up an example serverless REST API on AWS using API Gateway and Lambda

3) Demonstrate the "Serverless Framework" ( https://serverless.com/ ), an open-source framework designed to automate deployment of serverless apps

4) Bonus example, time permitting: Use the Serverless Framework and AWS Developer Portal to create a new Alexa skill.
