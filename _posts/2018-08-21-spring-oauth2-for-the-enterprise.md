6-6:30 networking and food
6:30 presentation

The Spring Boot support for OAuth2 seems simple when you look at online examples, but what do you do when your Identity Provider is not Google or Facebook? Take a look past ‘Hello World: OAuth2 edition’ with an overview of how to implement an OAuth2 and JWT-based Authorization Server in an enterprise environment.

OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords (Wikipedia). This talk will include a high-level overview of the protocol, Spring Boot support for OAuth2, and how it is being used at Mutual of Omaha, including some code examples.

Jeff Quandt has over 15 years of experience developing enterprise systems in a variety of business sectors. Currently, he is a solution architect at Mutual of Omaha supporting a multi-year program to replace a legacy mainframe with event-driven Spring Boot microservices.
