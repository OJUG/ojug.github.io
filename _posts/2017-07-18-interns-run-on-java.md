---

6-6:30pm networking
6:30 presentation

Java is the programming language that Omaha software development interns are expected to have in their tool belts. We’ll cover one returning student’s 18-month journey through the JVM, from “hello world” to building a microservice in Spring.

Additional topics include: what is and isn’t taught in school, intern and junior developer expectations, plunging into an ever-evolving industry, and maintaining blooming developer’s imagination and drive.
