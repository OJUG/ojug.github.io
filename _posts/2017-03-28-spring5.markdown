March Madness is here with an extra special meetup. In addition to our regulary schedule March 21st meeting. OJUG is working with the Spring Users Group to co-host a Spring 5 talk from Josh Long!

## Details below.

Spring 5 is almost here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on the Pivotal Reactor project to support message-driven, elastic, resilient and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime, how existing Servlet code can run on the new world, and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies.
