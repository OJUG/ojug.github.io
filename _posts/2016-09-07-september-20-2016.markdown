## Presentation

The presentation will be a short demo and then architecture discussion/code walk-through of [mirror][mirror], a two-way/real-time version of rsync. Mirror is built on top of [grpc][grpc], which is Google's new RPC-over-Protobuf project, so we'll also briefly cover how that works, what the proto files look like, etc.
