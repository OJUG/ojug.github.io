Details
David Corrado is a Mobile Software Engineer at FanDuel and will be speaking about the state of mobile apps, native versus hybrid.

Presentation Overview:
"State of Mobile Apps: Native vs Hybrid" "All companies want to save money by sharing a code base between iOS and Android apps. We will weigh the pros and cons of doing hybrid with different frameworks. I will be giving my opinion from the point of view from a native developer who works with startups and enterprise applications. There will be extra focus on the hybrid frameworks that I think are the best fit for startups and for enterprise applications"
