Test automation lies at the heart of Agile software development. Having automated tests often improves code quality, increases confidence that code works as anticipated, and also ensures that end users quickly receive a product that suits their needs. At the March meetup, we will be diving into the basics of UI test automation and discussing some of the benefits of writing test cases for enterprise applications. Our speaker for the evening is Lauren Koperski. Lauren is an Application Developer at Mutual of Omaha and has worked to create an automated UI test suite for an internal application, which due in part to its technical state, has become one of the primary candidates for use in experimentation with newer technologies. Mutual of Omaha is our sponsor for the evening, providing food and beverage, beginning at 5:15pm. Lauren Koperski will begin her automated testing talk at 6pm and then we will open it up for discussion and questions at 6:45pm.
