title:  "August 18, 2015 the Java Spark framework"
---

Java Spark (http://sparkjava.com/): Ruby developers get some of the coolest toys. They have these fun little frameworks that just do stuff in the most annoying way. Sinatra is one of those frameworks. Luckily for us Per Wendel decided that Java devs should get in on the fun, and so now we have the Java Spark framework (http://sparkjava.com/), because Ruby shouldn't get all the cool toys.

Bio: Seth Lachner (https://twitter.com/Slestac) is very cool. He's is a long time member of OJUG.org. His talks are always wonderful.
