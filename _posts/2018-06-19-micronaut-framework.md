title:  "June 19, 2018 Micronaut FrameWork"
---

5:30-6pm networking and food
6pm presentation

In this talk, Jeff Brown will demonstrate how the future of Grails, GORM, and Micronaut are linked, as well as how the OCI Groovy and Grails team is taking productivity around developing microservices to the next level!

Micronaut is a new JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice applications. Unlike reflection-based IoC frameworks, which load and cache reflection data for every single field, method, and constructor in your code, with Micronaut, your application startup time and memory consumption are not bound to the size of your codebase.

The Micronaut framework shares many core values with Grails, including the enablement of code simplicity and developer productivity. Micronaut offers many additional features for a new class of applications (e.g., microservices, serverless deployments, etc.) that may not be well-suited for Grails.

Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:
* Sub-second startup time
* Tiny processes that may run in as little as 8mb of heap
* No runtime reflection
* Dependency injection
* Load balancing
* And more!

BIO:
Jeff Scott Brown is the co-founder of the Grails and Micronaut frameworks, leads the Grails and Micronaut practices at OCI (objectcomputing.com), and is also Partner at OCI. He has been doing JVM application development for as long as the JVM has existed.
