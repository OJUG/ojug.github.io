title:  "August 19, 2014 Katas will make us better"
---

Jessica Codr (https://twitter.com/JCake09) and John Davis (https://twitter.com/yatz3000) will lead a discussion of katas and lead us through (at least) two katas.

Katas are hands on exercises that serve as a great way to get more familiar with programming languages, IDEs, and processes like TDD. They are all about refining our skills as developers through deliberate practice (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)). Attendees are encouraged to bring their own laptops and follow along with the kata exercise. If you don't have a laptop, we will do our best to provide one for you or pair you up with someone else who has a laptop. We will be doing 2-3 katas, including the "prime factors kata" to demonstrate the great power of TDD and a kata using Mockito.

Jessica and John will be leading the katas in Eclipse, so participants should have Eclipse already installed on their laptops.

Agenda:
