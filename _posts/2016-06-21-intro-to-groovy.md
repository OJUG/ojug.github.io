Intro To Groovy

We’ll run through a whirl-wind tour of the Groovy (http://www.groovy-lang.org/) language, pointing out a few things that differentiate Groovy from Java. Syntax and code style will be covered and we’ll introduce closures and Traits. There are real labs that we can cover to get you more familiar with the basic concepts!
