Microservices and DevOps Live

Many Microservices presentations talk about the benefits and design patterns of Microservices through diagrams, bullet point concepts, and discussion.  

In this presentation we will take the next step and demonstrate an actual Microservices application implementation, with a live display of a durable, stable, and flexible Microservices platform automated with DevOps tooling.

Keyhole Software is currently lending support to enterprise companies across the country on Microservices in both Java and .Net technology stacks.


The following features will be demonstrated: 
1. Scaling a Service  
1. Continuous Deployment of a Service (adding new features, fixing bugs) 
1. Containerizing a Service With Docker  
1. Monitoring Circuit Breakers Under Load With Hystrix Dashboard  
1. Handling Open Circuits  
1. Log Aggregation 
1. Container/Service Orchestration  
1. On-Demand Resource Allocation 
1. Routing and Orchestration  

Technology Stack Demonstrated 

The reference Microservices application is implemented using a single-page application (Angular SPA) UI, Spring Boot [Pivotal.io](http://pivotal.io/), and Netflix OSS frameworks.   

The DevOps SDLC environment will utilize Docker, Maven, Git, and Jenkins. They will be configured to provide a continuous delivery mechanism to a cloud-based infrastructure. Other infrastructure options such as cloud or on-premise cloud environments will also be discussed.
