title:  "March 16, 2023 Bootify.io - jump start your Spring Boot apps - with Matt Payne"
---

Please join us (w/ food and drinks!) as **Matt Payne** presents "**Bootify.io** - **jump start your Spring Boot apps**"! Bring your laptop and code along with the presentation!

**Abstract:**
It's one thing to read about spring boot, spring data JPA and other technology. It's even better to generate a short, self-contained, correct ready-to-run example quickly. Thomas Surmann's Bootify.io web application is fabulous for learning or starting a new application.
Come learn about the SaaS web application Bootify.io, the "Best developer experience for starting Spring Boot apps ‚Äê best practices included."
We'll discuss and work through the following (bring your laptop if you'd like to play along):

1. A tour of the free tier of great SaaS that is Bootify.io
2. Generating many to many relationships with JPA (spring data)
3. h2Database.com - Quick & easy all Java Database with an easy-to-use web console
4. Then we'll swap h2 out for PostgreSQL.
5. API generation with swagger (OpenAPI) using Bootify
6. Thymeleaf GUI that sits alongside the APIs
7. HTMX.org is an excellent (language-neutral) way to mix AJAX into your application for single-page app-like interactivity.
8. We'll do all the `mvn install` work in the cloud -- no heavy downloads on wifi. How? We'll demo two cloud development environments.
9. See how quick & easy to use GitPOD.io's free tier is for cloud development environments to explore a GitHub repository.
10. See how quick & easy GitHub's Codespaces are to use. Currently, GitHub gives away "up to 60 hours a month free" of Codespaces to each user.

We'll use the sample repo [https://github.com/payne/team2](https://github.com/payne/team2) that was created in minutes using Bootify.io.
