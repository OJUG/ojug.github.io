---

Join us for a talk from Steve Riesenberg from the Spring Security team!

Note: Moving to a Tuesday for this month to fit a few schedules - and location at DevObsessed

**Building Modern Apps with OAuth2 and Spring**

Have you ever been so excited to start building a shiny new application, only to lose momentum when adding security to your project? Have you ever wondered how to build application architectures that are secure from the start? Are you using Spring, but not quite sure which projects to reach for first and how they all fit together?

In this talk, we will examine a modern application architecture including multiple secured microservices, and see how various Spring projects come together to make this work. We will learn how OAuth2 fits seamlessly into this architecture to create modern applications that are resilient, adaptable and production-ready. We will also explore using Spring Boot's OAuth2 Authorization Server support to standardize our OAuth2 configuration while providing the flexibility to connect to multiple third party identity providers.
