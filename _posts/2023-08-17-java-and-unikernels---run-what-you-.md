title:  "August 17, 2023 Java and Unikernels - Run what you Need - with Aaron Grothe"
---

Please join us (w/ food and drinks!) as **Aaron Grothe** presents "**Java and Unikernels - Run what you Need**"!

Also **note the address:** this event will be at Object Partners/Improving's new office out west!

**Abstract:**
Unikernels take the idea of an operating system and strip it down to just what you need to run your program. This can reduce the size of your containers, reduce the potential attack surface and increase performance. There are tradeoffs as well in terms of increased complexity and reduced flexibility.

This talk will go through the basics of using Unikernels with Java with several quick demos. Hopefully, people will leave the talk with thinking about adding unikernels to their toolbox.

**Speaker:**
Aaron Grothe is a Systems/Architect at an Omaha company. He's been published in 2600 magazine several times and is a two-time IOCCC winner. For more information hit his website at [https://grothe.us](https://grothe.us)

**Schedule:**
Food and Networking: 5:30 - 6:00
Presentation: 6:00 - 7:00
Jetbrains IntelliJ license raffle for in-person attendees after the talk!
