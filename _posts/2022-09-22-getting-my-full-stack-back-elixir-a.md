title:  "September 22, 2022 Getting My Full-Stack Back: Elixir and Phoenix.LiveView with Scott Hickey"
---

Please join us in-person (w/ pizza and drinks!) as Omaha's own Scott Hickey presents an Elixir talk titled "Getting My Full-Stack Back: Elixir and Phoenix.LiveView"!

**Abstract:**
As front-end, back-end, and hosting technologies have become more complex over time, the concept of a full-stack engineer has faded. Elixir and Phoenix LiveView reverses that trend. In this presentation, youâ€™ll see what differentiates Phoenix LiveView from the typical stack used in most new applications and what inspired the former president of OJUG to take all of his Java books to the Goodwill and go all-in on Elixir!

**Speaker:**
Scott Hickey ([https://twitter.com/jsh_elixir_dev](https://twitter.com/jsh_elixir_dev)) is the Elixir Practice Lead for [DevObsessed](https://www.devobsessed.com/). Scott has over 30 years of software engineering experience. He has worked as a software engineer, team lead, architect, coach and mentor for companies of all sizes including several in the Fortune 500. Scott started #coding in C/C++ for several years before he started working with Java in 1998. He began working with Groovy in 2005 and led the open source project for the Groovy Eclipse plugin. Scott has spoken at local, regional, national and international conferences and has been actively involved in local programming user groups.
