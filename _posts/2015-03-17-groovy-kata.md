title:  "March 17, 2015 Groovy kata"
---

At this meeting, we’ll work through a solution to the Bank OCR kata, http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl/index.pl?KataBankOCR, using Groovy and functional programming techniques. As we work through this programming kata using Groovy, we’ll use pure functions that are small and easy to test. The code will use recursion plus Groovy methods that support functional programming such as take, drop, first, tail, find, findAll, collect, collectMany, and transpose.

Speaker: Scott Hickey is Chief Technologist (Object Partners, Inc.) at Mutual of Omaha. He is a wonderful speaker and very nice guy.
