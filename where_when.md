Omaha Java Users Group (OJUG.org) ususally meets the third Thursday of each month.   Usually we take December off, and sometimes November.  Everyone likes holidays.

We meet at various locations around Omaha -- thank you to our host sponsors! Reach out if you'd like to host a meeting!

Meetings are usually announced both here and on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/omahajava/).
