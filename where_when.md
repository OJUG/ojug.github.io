Omaha Java Users Group (OJUG.org) ususally meets the third Thursday of each month. We don't meet every single month, but would love to host if you've got something to speak about!

We meet at various locations around Omaha -- thank you to our host sponsors! Reach out if you'd like to host a meeting!

Meetings are usually announced both here and on [Luma](https://lu.ma/omahajava).
